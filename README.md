Field Orientated Control depends on projections which change a three phase time and speed subordinate framework into a two coordinate ( d and q co-ordinates) time invariant reference. Field orientated controlled machines need two constants as information references: the torque component (lined up with the q co-ordinate) and the transition component (lined up with d co-ordinate). As Field Orientated Control is just founded on projections the control structure handles prompt electrical amounts. This makes the control precise in each working operation (steady state and transient) and free of the constrained data transmission scientific model.
